This windows-form project has been developed using C#.

In this project, there are login panels for administrators, students, and teachers. The main purpose of the project is for students to apply for the courses they want to take and the teachers they prefer.
Teachers can view the students who have applied, see the courses they are teaching and the grades, and also have the ability to accept or reject the applications.
